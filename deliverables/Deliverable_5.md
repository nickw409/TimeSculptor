# Description
Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This will help understand the context of your design decisions. You can reuse and update text from the previous deliverables.

*Grading criteria (2 points): Completeness; Consistency with the rest of the document; Adequate language.*

# Architecture
Present a diagram of the high-level architecture of your system. Use a UML package diagram to describe the main modules and how they interrelate. See some examples at [here](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/package-diagrams-examples.html). Make clear the layers of your architecture (if they exist) as described in [here](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multi-layered-application-uml-model-diagram-example.html). Provide a brief rationale of your architecture explaining why you designed it that way.

*Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of an architecture for the system; Adequate description of the rationale.*

# Class Diagram
Present a refined class diagram of your system, including implementation details such as visibilities, attributes to represent associations, attribute types, return types, parameters, etc. The class diagram should match the code you have produced so far, but not be limited to it (e.g., it can contain classes not implemented yet).

The difference between this class diagram and the one that you presented in D.3 is that the last focuses on the conceptual model of the domain while the former reflects the implementation. Therefore, the implementation details are relevant in this case.

*Grading criteria (6 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate choice of classes and relationships; Completeness of the diagram; Adequate presentation of implementation details.*

# Sequence Diagram
Present a sequence diagram that represents how the objects in your system interact for a specific use case. Also include the use case's description in this section. The sequence diagram should be consistent with the class diagram and architecture.

*Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of the sequence diagram; Consistency with the class diagram; Consistency with the use case description; Not including the use case description; Over simplistic diagram.*

# Design Patterns
Split this section into 2 subsections. For each subsection, present a UML class diagram showing the application of a design pattern to your system (a different pattern for each section). Each class diagram should contain only the classes involved in the specific pattern (you donâ€™t need to represent the whole system). Choose patterns from two different categories: Behavioral, Structural, and Creational. You are not limited to design patterns studied in class.

Your system may not be appropriate for any design pattern. In this case, for didactic purposes, be creative and extend a little bit the scope of your system to make the design patterns appropriate.

Implement each design pattern in your system and provide GitHub links to the corresponding classes. Example (the links are just illustrative):

- Event [EventClass](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/blob/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/events.jsx)
  ![EventFactory](../assets/FactoryDesignPattern.drawio.png)
- IBreakBehavior: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/IBreakBehavior.java)
- BrakeWithABS: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/BrakeWithABS.java)
- Brake: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Brake.java)

*Grading criteria (6 points, 3 for each pattern): Correct use of the design pattern as described in the literature; Adequate choice of the design pattern; Adequate implementation of the design pattern.*

# Design Principles
How does your design observe the SOLID principles? Provide a short description of followed principles giving concrete examples from your classes.

*Grading criteria (6 points): Show correct understanding of SOLID principles; Provide enough details to justify how the design observes the SOLID principles.*
