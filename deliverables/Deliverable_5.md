# Description
UI design is often built around the needs of neurotypical people. As a result, many apps miss UI features that improve ease of use for people with learning disabilities. One example of this is with Calendar apps, which, while extensive, often have complex UIs that aren't learning disability friendly. As a result, there should be a calendar app that prioritizes accessibility by following UI guidelines that accomodate those with learning disabilities. For those that have a learning disability who could greatly benefit from a scheduling app designed specifically with their needs in mind, TimeSculptor accommodates these needs by adhering to UI styling guidelines laid out by Pavlov (2014) and Moreno et al. (2023). For example, Pavolv (2014) states that a key aspect of accesibile UIs is to ensure that all ideas have an associated picture. Apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar do not prioritize this, as events are typically just shown as text (with some niche exceptions like birthdays in Google Calendar). TimeSculptor will put these needs at the forefront, ensuring that the app adheres as closely as possible to them. Overall, TimeSculptor is a scheduling app built for people with learning disabilities, our expected consumer segment. It provides a much easier and accessible interface that adheres to research based on building UI that is learning disability friendly.

The system requirements for TimeSculptor are defined thusly. First, users must be able to register with a valid email, username, and password. Each user will also have different personalized settings, which enable them to personalize their experience. For example, they can change their notification preferences, such as turning them on/off or changing the frequency at which notifications are sent. Each notification has a set date it is sent out, as well as content that will remind the user to update their schedule, and/or of upcoming events. Aside from this, the user can build a schedule that is tied to them, which is comprised of days will contain various events. The schedule will have different view options, such as list, daily, or weekly. The schedule also has inidividual days, which have a date, possible associated holidays, and have events that are scheduled within them. Each event contained within the schedule will have relevant information, like the name, date, start time, end time, associated color, and related picture. There are also recurring events which are a form of event that reoccur on a time interval, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Another feature of TimeSculptor will be that it allows users to be friends, enabling users to compare their schedules via compare requests. In these compare requests, a user will initiate a request, which can then be accepted by another user. These compare requests will have a header, content, sent date, and accepted date. Once accepted, each of the users can use the compare request to view the other's schedule in order to schedule an event together.

# Architecture
Present a diagram of the high-level architecture of your system. Use a UML package diagram to describe the main modules and how they interrelate. See some examples at [here](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/package-diagrams-examples.html). Make clear the layers of your architecture (if they exist) as described in [here](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multi-layered-application-uml-model-diagram-example.html). Provide a brief rationale of your architecture explaining why you designed it that way.

*Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of an architecture for the system; Adequate description of the rationale.*

# Class Diagram
Present a refined class diagram of your system, including implementation details such as visibilities, attributes to represent associations, attribute types, return types, parameters, etc. The class diagram should match the code you have produced so far, but not be limited to it (e.g., it can contain classes not implemented yet).

The difference between this class diagram and the one that you presented in D.3 is that the last focuses on the conceptual model of the domain while the former reflects the implementation. Therefore, the implementation details are relevant in this case.

*Grading criteria (6 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate choice of classes and relationships; Completeness of the diagram; Adequate presentation of implementation details.*

# Sequence Diagram
Present a sequence diagram that represents how the objects in your system interact for a specific use case. Also include the use case's description in this section. The sequence diagram should be consistent with the class diagram and architecture.

*Grading criteria (5 points): Adequate use of UML; Adequate design of the sequence diagram; Consistency with the class diagram; Consistency with the use case description; Not including the use case description; Over simplistic diagram.*

# Design Patterns
Split this section into 2 subsections. For each subsection, present a UML class diagram showing the application of a design pattern to your system (a different pattern for each section). Each class diagram should contain only the classes involved in the specific pattern (you donâ€™t need to represent the whole system). Choose patterns from two different categories: Behavioral, Structural, and Creational. You are not limited to design patterns studied in class.

Your system may not be appropriate for any design pattern. In this case, for didactic purposes, be creative and extend a little bit the scope of your system to make the design patterns appropriate.

Implement each design pattern in your system and provide GitHub links to the corresponding classes. Example (the links are just illustrative):

- Event [EventClass](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/blob/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/events.jsx)
  ![EventFactory](../assets/FactoryDesignPattern.drawio.png)
- IBreakBehavior: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/IBreakBehavior.java)
- BrakeWithABS: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/BrakeWithABS.java)
- Brake: [link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/src/com/proj/main/Brake.java)

*Grading criteria (6 points, 3 for each pattern): Correct use of the design pattern as described in the literature; Adequate choice of the design pattern; Adequate implementation of the design pattern.*

# Design Principles
How does your design observe the SOLID principles? Provide a short description of followed principles giving concrete examples from your classes.

*Grading criteria (6 points): Show correct understanding of SOLID principles; Provide enough details to justify how the design observes the SOLID principles.*
