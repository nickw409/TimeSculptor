**Key Insights:**
   - To many pop ups will become annoying if they appear to often
   - Being able to choose when and what is presented is key to its desirability
   - A priority system for what to be notified about is needed so that the notifications don't get cluttered 
   - Traffic information is a priority concern for what is often checked say to day

**Representative quotes:**
   - “I don't need to know about a small earthquake half a state away in the middle of the night, that can wait until I wake up”
   - “I don't want to keep getting updates though the day, just a few times are really what I need”

**Hypotheses that were validated:**

**Assessment:** Must have

### Interview 4: 
**Summary:** Roommate. 22 year old. Very outdoors. First impulse was negative, “Don't tell me what to do” Tone is important. MUST be customizable. Emergency communication area is a MUST. Filter out what she wants. Tags that can denote severity or subject matter. Social impact.
**Interviewer:** Chris Keefe
**Interviewee:** Laura No Puckett
**When:**  2/13/20

**Consumer segments:**
- Outdoorspeople

**Key Insights:**
- Risk-management information may not be perceived as a need
- Some people may “not want to be told what to do”
- Notifications must be customized/customizable or we risk alienating independence-focused users

**Representative quotes:**
- “I don’t want some external thing telling me to panic. I like to be in control - I don’t want something else telling me what to do”
- “I want to be notified about when people are contacting me - but not much else. I don’t want notifications, unless its people. …. But If there’s a major flood, I don’t care how often it notifies me.”

**Hypotheses that were validated:**
- Users find value in notifications of major risks/inconveniences
- Users prefer a customizable notification stream

**Assessment:**
- Must have - minimal channel of relevant emergency notifications
- Nice to have - additional channels
- Nice to have - filtering by flags in addition to per-channel opt-in

### Interview 5: 
**Summary:** If there is no value, no one will care. Did not sound interested. OPT IN over opt out. I don't want more apps sending them things. Crisis only channel that comes with, everything else is opt in. Worry fuel. Battery lose issue
Interviewer: Chris Keefe
Interviewee: Heidi Rodenhizer
When: 2/13/19
Consumer segments:
- Outdoorspeople
- Property Managers/Landlords
        
**Key Insights:**
- “Choosing channels that you’re interested in would be best”
- Users might need encouragement to sign up - doesn’t seem critical or particularly useful to them
- Performance/battery loss might be a stopper

**Representative quotes**
- “I’d only use it if I thought there was a reason to use it. If there’s some obvious indicator that there’s something happening (if there’s a really huge storm happening, if I just felt the ground shake)”

**Hypotheses that were validated**
- Users will not actively check a clearinghouse like this, but would appreciate notifications
- Performance/battery loss might be a stopper

**Assessment:**
- Must have - lightweight
- Must have - possible to provide only useful notifications

### Interview 6:

**Interviewer:** Noah Schwartz\
**Interviewee:** Erica Schwartz\
**When:** 9/15/23\
**Consumer Segment:**
-Adult who has the need for scheduling their day

**Key Insights:**
   - In theory, this is a cool concept but doesn't seem all too new and original
   - The idea of being able to compare schedules to see free time easier is best feature

**Representative quotes:**
   - “Especially for our Shabbat Group, it is very hard even to schedule one night a month to get together, having the ability to see everyone's free time right away by comparing schedules sounds like a very useful thing.”

**Hypotheses that were validated:**
   - People feel the need for a scheduling app that makes hanging out easier.
**Assessment:**
   - Nice to have: Most features of a scheduling app
   - Nice to have: Comparison of schedules.
