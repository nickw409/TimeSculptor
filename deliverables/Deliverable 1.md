# Project Inception

_Group 04 – “[TimeSculptor]”\
Date and location: September 17, 2023\
Group Members: Izaac Molina, Joey Banazsak, Kimberly Allison, Nicholas Wiley, Gabriel Valentin, Noah Schwartz

## 1. Introduction

In a world rich with information, there's no reason you should be suprised by an accident in your neighborhood, a rain squall on your walk to work, or a natural disaster approaching your community. Don’t Panic is an application platform designed to prevent accidents by providing timely, geo-targeted warnings, alongside resources to help people navigate the worst of times. Users opt in to receive push notifications or SMS. Users receive advice when they may be a) approaching a high-risk area or b) entering a high-risk time period. (E.g. weather bulletins, breaking news, seasonal risks) Future work may include suppression of notifications when geolocation data indicates the user is moving at motor-vehicle speeds, creation of opt-in channels for content selection, notification filtering by tag, and API design to allow approved local/regional/national partners to post warnings in real time
