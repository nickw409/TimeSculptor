# Project Inception

_Group 04 – “[TimeSculptor]”\
Date and location: September 17, 2023\
Group Members: Izaac Molina, Joey Banazsak, Kimberly Allison, Nicholas Wiley, Gabriel Valentin, Noah Schwartz

## 1. Introduction

In a world rich with information, there's no reason you should be suprised by an accident in your neighborhood, a rain squall on your walk to work, or a natural disaster approaching your community. Don’t Panic is an application platform designed to prevent accidents by providing timely, geo-targeted warnings, alongside resources to help people navigate the worst of times. Users opt in to receive push notifications or SMS. Users receive advice when they may be a) approaching a high-risk area or b) entering a high-risk time period. (E.g. weather bulletins, breaking news, seasonal risks) Future work may include suppression of notifications when geolocation data indicates the user is moving at motor-vehicle speeds, creation of opt-in channels for content selection, notification filtering by tag, and API design to allow approved local/regional/national partners to post warnings in real time

### Interview 4:

- Some people may “not want to be told what to do”
- Notifications must be customized/customizable or we risk alienating independence-focused users

**Representative quotes:**
- “I don’t want some external thing telling me to panic. I like to be in control - I don’t want something else telling me what to do”
- “I want to be notified about when people are contacting me - but not much else. I don’t want notifications, unless its people. …. But If there’s a major flood, I don’t care how often it notifies me.”

- Users find value in notifications of major risks/inconveniences
- Users prefer a customizable notification stream

**Assessment:**
- Must have - minimal channel of relevant emergency notifications
- Nice to have - additional channels
- Nice to have - filtering by flags in addition to per-channel opt-in

### Interview 5: 
**Summary:** If there is no value, no one will care. Did not sound interested. OPT IN over opt out. I don't want more apps sending them things. Crisis only channel that comes with, everything else is opt in. Worry fuel. Battery lose issue

Interviewee: Heidi Rodenhizer
When: 2/13/19
Consumer segments:
- Outdoorspeople
- Property Managers/Landlords
        
**Key Insights:**
- “Choosing channels that you’re interested in would be best”
- Users might need encouragement to sign up - doesn’t seem critical or particularly useful to them
- Performance/battery loss might be a stopper

**Representative quotes**
- “I’d only use it if I thought there was a reason to use it. If there’s some obvious indicator that there’s something happening (if there’s a really huge storm happening, if I just felt the ground shake)”

**Hypotheses that were validated**
- Users will not actively check a clearinghouse like this, but would appreciate notifications
- Performance/battery loss might be a stopper

**Assessment:**
- Must have - lightweight
- Must have - possible to provide only useful notifications

### Interview 6:

**Summary:** Traffic. Forewarning of crisis. Felt the benefit of the app. But tone is important. Opt out/filter is key component. If done well she would download.

**Interviewee:** Caitlin Keefe\
**When:** 2/14/20\
**Consumer Segment:**
- People who commute through/live in dangerous areas
- Victims of Environmental Disaster/People at risk thereof

   - Opt-in to channels, and filter unwanted notifications

**Representative quotes:**
   - “Being able to be prepared in advance would help. I don’t like uncertainty - that’s the most terrifying for me. Having a clear map to “maybe you should start getting toilet paper”... that would be great. That would help me mentally.”

   - Notifications should have linked resources for further investigation

**Assessment:**
   - Must have - non-alarming tone
