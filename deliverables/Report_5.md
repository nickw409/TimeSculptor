## **Project Retrospective**

**Appreciations:** Everyone continued learning their assigned technologies and contributed to the research for a new value proposition

**Successes:** Communication has remained consistent, it still feels as if everyone is still contributing. Additionally, Report was turned in on the set soft deadline. Finally, team is showing flexibility in changing direction for the project

**Failures:** No work was done Deliverable 3.

**Barriers:** Unsure of overall project idea, feedback from Deliverable 1 has made the team consider a significant change in the project

**What We Should Try Next Time:** Definitively figure out the project idea and confirm with Dr. Palmer that our new idea is good to go forward with, then complete Deliverable 3 based on that.


## **Next Steps**
- Continue Learning assigned technologies
- Plan the different pages of the website (login, calendar, etc…)
- Start working on Deliverable 3
- Finalize new project idea/value proposition.

## **Decisions**
- Sticking with the general idea, pivoting towards improving accessibility for all learning disabilities through guidelines found in UI studies.

 - If this idea doesn’t work out, a full pivot is in order and the brand new idea will be decided by the next meeting.
